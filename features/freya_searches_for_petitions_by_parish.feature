Feature: Freya searches petitions by parish
  In order to see what petitions are relevant to other people in my parish
  As Freya, a member of the general public
  I want to use my postcode to find my parish and see petitions with signatures from people who also live in it

  Background:
    Given a parish "Saint Martin" is found by postcode "JE3 6AA"
    And a parish "Grouville" is found by postcode "JE9 1AA"
    And an open petition "Save the monkeys" with some signatures
    And an open petition "Restore vintage diggers" with some signatures
    And an open petition "Build more quirky theme parks" with some signatures
    And a closed petition "What about other primates?" with some signatures
    And a resident in "Grouville" supports "Restore vintage diggers"
    And few residents in "Saint Martin" support "Save the monkeys"
    And some residents in "Saint Martin" support "Build more quirky theme parks"
    And many residents in "Grouville" support "Build more quirky theme parks"
    And a resident in "Saint Martin" supports "What about other primates?"

    But I should not see that my fellow parish residents support "What about other primates?"
    And I should not see that my fellow parish residents support "Restore vintage diggers"
